Implementing a streamlined pull request review process with defined roles and responsibilities in Github involves establishing clear guidelines and workflows for efficient code review. Here's structured approach to achieve this:
1. Define reviewer roles and responsibilities - The individual who submits the PR for review. Reviewer : individuals responsible for reviewing and providing feedback on the code changes. Merge approver : a designated person responsible for approving
and merging the PR into the main branch after successful review.
2. Set clear expectations - Define criteria and standards for code review, such as coding conventions, testing requirements, documentation needs.
3. Use github's review features - Assign reviewers : assign specific individuals as reviewers for the PR. Review requests : request reviews from designated reviewers.
4. define reviewer workflow - reviewers responsibilities : reviewers should throughly examine the code changes, provide constructive feedback, and ensure alignment with coding standards and project goals.
